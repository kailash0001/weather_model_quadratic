# weather_model_quadratic
To implement weather modeling using the quadratic solution in stages (with hard-coded values, keyboard input, file input), we can treat the quadratic equation as a simplified temperature prediction model.

T(t) = at² + bt + c
Where:
•	T(t) is the temperature at time t
•	a, b, c are coefficients based on environmental or atmospheric data
•	This example shows how you might predict temperature at a given hour or day.
